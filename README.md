# Smooth PHP framework

Requirements: PHP version 5.3+, Apache and SQL server(needed for perfect usage of all Smooth features)

### What is Smooth?

Smooth is a Open Source PHP 5.3+ framework was developed with the clear idea for a powerful yet tiny and flexible toolkit for web development. 

No one wants to get into complicated codes with thousand lines of code without actually needing them. You won't need to write those files anymore, because Smooth uses a shorter syntax. Check out our documentation.

Smooth can be used by both advanced and beginner programmers within minutes after it is installed. You need only to download the latest version of the framework extract it and you are ready to go. In case of any issues check our community pages or write our professional support.
